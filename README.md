# Object Pool Example Code
## Conor O'Brien and Nathan Arrowsmith
## SDEV 426 Fall 2022

*This project was created for usage in teaching about the Object Pool design pattern.*

- The folder titled 'classexample' will be used for a code-along portion of the presentation.
- The folder titled 'objectpooltests' contains two driver classes used to compare runtime and memory usage between using an object pool and creating a large number of objects.
- The ObjectPoolMain class inside of the 'objectpooltests' folder also contains a console game that can be used in conjunction with an IDEs debugger to see some of the object pool functions in action (i.e. borrowing and returning pool objects).
